# Findings and Observations

    Movie Type: Documentaries and War Films
    Charts Used: (XY) Plot
    Years Covered: 2000-2022

## Synopsis
In this project, I collect data from IMDB and store it into MongoDB to read and perform an analysis between documentaries and war films. I use an XY Plot to visualize my findings. I will be answering the question: **Are documentaries and war films still relevant?**

## Analysis: Documentary and War Films Released From 2000 - 2022
The release of documentaries and war films seem to hit their peaks in the year 2005 and 2011, respectively. Through the years, both types of films have been on a decline. Releases for both documentaries and war films plummet just after their peak year, with the proceeding years being rather bumpy. Although production for both types of films witness somewhat of a resurgence between the years 2013 and 2020, they have been steadily declining. 

With the introduction to streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime video, cataloging classic films is one of the many selling points of these movie-streaming juggernauts. This is the case for war films and documentaries, especially. So why has there been a delcine in newer movies? 

From chart-topping war films like Hacksaw Ridge (2016) to critically acclaimed documentaries like March of the Penguins (2005), there are many great films of the past that have solidified themselves as iconic. Due to the oversaturation of these types of films, one might argue that these two genres have become stagnant. This is especially the case if we compare them to the current superhero-zeitgeist that has taken the world by storm. As we approach the end of the superhero era, war films and documentaries become a thing of the distant past. 

## Conclusion
This is not to say that no good war movies or documentarites are being produced anymore. For instance, All Quiet on the Western Front (2022) and My Octopus Teacher (2020) were both widely acclaimed by both audiences and critics. All this to say, the decline of these two genres may be a result of oversaturation, and being overshadowed by the current Hollywood fad of spandex-clad superheroes (more like green cgi-friendly spandex suits honestly).  

## Disclaimer
I am not a hater of superhero movies. I just rewatched Marvel phase 1-3 for the second time and find them very enjoyable. Has it become oversaturated? A bit - but thats a completely seperate topic.
